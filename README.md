Create a file containing your api key from 

https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/datapoint/api

echo "your-api-key" > /script-location/kindle-weather-display/server/apikey

Find your location ID from:

http://datapoint.metoffice.gov.uk/public/data/val/wxfcs/all/json/sitelist?key=<put your api key here>

And update the url line in ./server/new-weather-script.py (Replace XXXXXXX with your location ID

url='http://datapoint.metoffice.gov.uk/public/data/val/wxfcs/all/xml/XXXXXX?res=daily&key='+myApiKey

To use,	the server needs to run	the script, as a cronjob:

 0 * * * * /script-location/kindle-weather-display/server/weather-script.sh > /dev/null 2>&1

You can use Kite (https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=168270) or (https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=168270) as launchers, or run the script manually on a kindle via ssh:

Installing them is left as an exercise for the reader, as it varies between versions

Once installed, you can set a cronjob to run the script on the kindle too:

[root@kindle root]# mntroot rw
system: I mntroot:def:Making root filesystem writeable
[root@kindle root]# vi /etc/crontab/root 

 15 * * * * /mnt/us/weather/display-weather.sh

You can also manually run the above command to start the script/update directly.
